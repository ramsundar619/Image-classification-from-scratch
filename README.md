# Image classification from scratch using hot dog or not dataset
## Introduction
This code shows how to do image classification from scratch, starting from JPEG image files on disk, without leveraging pre-trained weights or a pre-made Keras Application model. The code is demonstrated on using the Kaggle Hot Dog-Not Hot Dog Dataset.
